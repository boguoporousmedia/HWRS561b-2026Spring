    "1. (10 points) Propose two questions that you think can be used as midterm oral exam questions. The questions should focus on some of the most critical concepts that we have covered so far in this course. Keep in mind that these are oral exam questions, so they should not involve detailed calculations; rather, they should focus on testing whether one can draw or develop conceptual pictures and formulate physical arguments. Make sure to describe your questions concisely and accurately. Ask one of your classmates to answer your questions. Then, summarize her/his answers below. Please also write your own comments on the answers. You should also put down her/his name.\n",

The aquifer and aquitard materials are water-wet with contact angle $\\theta = 0^\\circ$. A representative pore radius for the aquitard is 0.05 mm. A representative pore diameter for the confined aquifer is 1 mm. The hydraulic head of water in the aquitard (above the LNAPL) is identical to the hydraulic head of water in the aquifer (below the LNAPL), and water is hydrostatic everywhere. The densities of water and LNAPL are 1.0 and 0.975 g cm$^{-3}$, respectively. The interfacial tension between LNAPL and water is 0.02 N m$^{-1}$.\n",

In a pore bundle, intrinsic permeability contribution from a tube scales with $r^2$. Therefore, draining/filling a small fraction of large pores can change phase permeability disproportionately. \n",

    "Wetting vs nonwetting curves differ because the wetting phase tend to remain in small pores, while the nonwetting phase mainly occupies larger pores and often needs an entry threshold before forming connected pathways. Thus, at the same saturation, wetting-phase $k_{rw}$ and nonwetting-phase $k_{rn}$ are generally different.\n",
