(b) Based on the bundle-of-tubes model and this insight, explain why porosity alone is insufficient to characterize permeability. For example, is it possible that two soil media with the same porosity have different permeabilities? Similarly, is it possible that a soil medium with greater porosity has smaller permeability than a soil medium with smaller porosity? Explain why or why not.\n",

    "**1(a)** In the bundle‑of‑tubes model, take $N$ identical straight tubes of radius $r$ and length $L$ in a REV of total cross‑sectional area $A$. Porosity is\n",
    "$\\phi = \\frac{N \\pi r^2}{A}$.\n",

    "Comparing with Darcy’s law $$q_D = -\n",
    "\\frac{k}{\\mu}\\,\n",
    "\\frac{\\Delta P}{L}$$ gives\n",
    "$k \\propto \\phi r^2$,\n",
    "so for fixed tube size (or fixed characteristic pore size) $k$ scales linearly with $\\phi$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1(b)** Porosity alone does not fix the pore size, connectivity, or tortuosity, all of which strongly affect permeability. Two soils can have the same porosity but different pore sizes or connectivity, producing different $k$. A soil with larger porosity can even have smaller $k$ if its pores are finer, more tortuous, or poorly connected compared with a lower‑porosity soil with larger, well‑connected pores. Thus $k$ depends on both $\\phi$ and pore geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2** Mechanical dispersion reflects variability in pore‑scale velocities and pathways (fast/slow channels, velocity gradients). It spreads a plume at the Darcy scale by rearranging concentrations across streamlines, but it does not by itself homogenize concentration within pores. True mixing at the pore scale requires molecular diffusion (or possibly local eddying under higher Reynolds number flow).\n",
    "\n",
    "**3(a)** The advection–diffusion (or advection–dispersion) equation averages out pore‑scale velocity variations, pore geometry, and local diffusion/mixing processes. It replaces the detailed pore‑scale transport with averaged (Darcy‑scale) advection and an effective diffusion/dispersion term.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3(b)** Upscaling can fail when the REV is not representative or when transport is strongly non‑Fickian, e.g., in highly heterogeneous media with preferential flow and long tailing, fractured rock where matrix diffusion dominates, or when sharp concentration fronts at small scales persist so that local equilibrium assumptions break down.\n"

    "**Answers:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**(1)** Taylor–Aris dispersion shows that in laminar flow through a tube, velocity varies across the cross‑section. Solute in fast and slow streamlines departs from each other, which over time produces an effective longitudinal spreading much larger than molecular diffusion alone. The result is an enhanced, Fickian‑like dispersion at long times with an effective coefficient that depends on the velocity profile and diffusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(2)** These insights justify using a Darcy‑scale advection–dispersion model: small‑scale velocity variations plus molecular diffusion lead to an emergent, approximately Fickian spreading at larger scales. Thus, it is reasonable to represent unresolved pore‑scale heterogeneity with an effective dispersive term, while recognizing assumptions (steady flow, sufficient transverse mixing, scale separation, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "**(3)** Without molecular diffusion were zero, solute in fast and slow streamlines still departs from each other and Taylor–Aris dispersion would still occur.\n"
