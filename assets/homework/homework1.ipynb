    "    - (5 points) In the bundle-of-tubes model, we discussed in class that permeability scales linearly with porosity. (a) Show why permeability scales linearly with porosity. (b) Based on the bundle-of-tubes model and this insight, explain why porosity alone is insufficient to characterize permeability. For example, is it possible that two soil media with the same porosity have different permeabilities? Similarly, is it possible that a soil medium with greater porosity has smaller permeability than a soil medium with smaller porosity? Explain why or why not.\n",

    "    - (5 points) Mechanical dispersion produces spreading of solute plumes at the Darcy scale. Explain why this spreading should not be interpreted as true mixing at the pore scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - (5 points) The advection–diffusion equation is written at the Darcy scale. (a) Which pore-scale processes are being averaged out to obtain this equation? (b) Give one example where this upscaling might fail or produce misleading results.\n"

    "2. (20 points) Consider a semi-infinite horizontal soil column undergoing steady-state, saturated horizontal flow. The porosity of the soil is 0.3. The Darcy flux is 0.3 m/day. Now consider a solute transport problem. Initially, the domain is solute-free, so $C(x, t=0) = 0$. From $t=0$ to $t=1$ day, solute with concentration $C_0$ is injected into the domain from the left boundary at $x=0$ cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - (10 points) Assuming that the water velocity and solute concentration at the REV scale are always uniform at any cross-section of the soil column, i.e., both flow and solute transport can be considered 1D, derive the governing equation that describes solute transport using the mass conservation and flux laws presented in class. Use the same methodology that we used in class, but do it for this specific 1D problem, i.e., do not derive or use the general 3D equation from class and simplify to 1D. Your control volume is an arbitrary 1D interval of the soil column, and your final derived governing equation should not contain any integrals. Be sure to define all parameters in your equation.\n",

    "\n",
    "    - (5 points) Sketch the solutions of solute concentration $c(x,t)$ at three times, $t=2$, 5, 10 days. You do not need to solve the equation to draw the solutions—just sketch what you conceptually think the solution would be. Explain why the shape of the concentration profile changes with time.\n"
