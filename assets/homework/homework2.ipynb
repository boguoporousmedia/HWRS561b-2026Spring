    "1. Consider one-dimensional conservative solute transport in a saturated homogeneous porous medium (with a length of $L$) governed by the advection–dispersion equation with constant porewater velocity ($V$) and dispersion coefficient ($D$).\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Starting from the advection–dispersion equation, use a scaling analysis to derive the characteristic time scale for:\n",
    "      - advection, $t_a$\n",
    "      - dispersion, $t_d$\n",
    "      \n",
    "      Clearly state the characteristic length scale you assume.\n",
    "   2. Define the Peclet number using these characteristic time scales and explain its physical meaning in one or two sentences.\n",
    "   3. A tracer is injected into a homogeneous sand column of length $L = 1$ m with porewater velocity $V = 0.5$ m/day.\n",
    "      - Case A: $D = 5 \\times 10^{-3}$ m $^2$ /day\n",
    "      - Case B: $D = 5 \\times 10^{-2}$ m $^2$ /day\n",
    "      \n",
    "      For each case:\n",
    "      - Compute $t_a$, $t_d$, and $Pe$\n",
    "      - State whether transport is advection-dominated, dispersion-dominated, or transitional\n",
    "      - Predict qualitatively how the breakthrough curve shape would differ between the two cases\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A conservative tracer is injected continuously at concentration $C_0$ into a laboratory column of length \\(L = 0.5\\) m. The initial concentration is zero everywhere. The porewater velocity is constant, and transport can be approximated as one-dimensional.\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Write the analytical solution for concentration $C(x,t)$ in a semi-infinite domain for a step change in inlet concentration.\n",
    "   2. Explain why this semi-infinite domain solution can be used to approximate a finite column experiment at early times. Clearly state the limitation of this approximation.\n",
    "   3. Using the semi-infinite solution, compute and plot breakthrough curves $C(L,t)/C_0$ at the column outlet for the following Peclet numbers:\n",
    "      - $Pe = 5$\n",
    "      - $Pe = 50$\n",
    "      - $Pe = 500$\n",
    "      \n",
    "      You may assume $L=0.5$ m and choose $V$ and $D$ accordingly.\n",
    "   4. On the same figure, compare the three breakthrough curves and answer:\n",
    "      - How does increasing Peclet number affect the steepness of the breakthrough curve?\n",
    "      - Which case best approximates piston flow?\n",
    "      - Which case shows the strongest early breakthrough and tailing?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Consider solute transport in a semi-infinite domain ($x \\ge 0$) with constant velocity $V$ and dispersion coefficient $D$. The initial concentration is zero everywhere. At the inlet ($x=0$), impose a flux boundary condition corresponding to two identical pulses of concentration: $-D \\partial C/\\partial x + V C = V C_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Pulse 1: $t=0$ to $t=t_0$\n",
    "   - Pulse 2: $t=T$ to $t=T+t_0$, where $T > t_0$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Far-field boundary condition: $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\partial C/\\partial x$ is finite.\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Write the analytical expression for concentration $C(x,t)$ due to a single pulse using the step-change continuous injection solution and the principle of superposition.\n",
    "   2. Using your result from (1), write the full analytical solution for the two-pulse injection at any location $x$ and time $t$.\n",
    "   3. Sketch (no computation required) the expected breakthrough curve at a fixed observation point $x = x_{obs}$, clearly indicating:\n",
    "      - arrival of each pulse\n",
    "      - overlap or separation depending on the relative magnitude of $T$, $t_0$, and dispersion\n",
    "   4. Briefly explain why superposition is valid for this problem and under what conditions it would no longer be valid."
