<h3>4. Course Description:</h3>

> This course is the second part of Physical Hydrogeology and focuses on the physical principles governing water flow and solute transport in variably saturated porous media. The course approaches these topics from a fundamental multiphase flow and transport perspective, with an emphasis on developing strong physical intuition. Building on this intuitive foundation, we formulate mathematical models and examine the physical behavior of solutions describing variably saturated flow and transport processes. The course also introduces selected cutting-edge topics related to the fate and transport of emerging contaminants in the subsurface, such as PFAS.

<h3>5. Prerequisites / Co-requisites:</h3>

> - No prerequisites.
> - Must be enrolled in the MS Hydrogeology program.
> - Required co-registration in HWRS 562b, HWRS 563b, HWRS 564b, and HWRS 565b.

<h3>6. Required Textbooks/Materials:</h3>

> - Contaminant Hydrogeology — C. W. Fetter, T. Boving, and D. Kreamer (2018)
> - Subsurface Hydrology — G. F. Pinder and M. A. Celia (2006)
> - Soil Physics — W. A. Jury and R. Horton (2004)

<h3>7. Assignments, Projects, and Exams:</h3>

> **Weekly assignments**
>
> Assignments are assigned every Monday and due the following Thursday by 10 pm. They include short answer/calculation questions and are designed for an average time budget of 2.5 hours per week.
>
> **Projects**
>
> Projects are assigned monthly and synthesize content across the five co-convened courses. You will receive a score (mastery, proficient, basic, or below basic) for each course area.
>
> **Exams**
>
> The midterm exam is oral and the final exam is written. Both are in-person. The final exam is scheduled during the exam week.
